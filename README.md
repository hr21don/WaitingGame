# WaitingGame
Your goal is to write a Python function to play a pulse pounding game of patience. 

## Challenge

When the player starts the program, it should print a message to wait a random amount of time, somwhere between 5 to 10 seconds. The player's goal is to wait the specified number of seconds and then press Enter again.

### Currently set to 10-60 seconds.
waitingTime = random.randint(10,60)

## Input
When the player presses Enter, that starts a timer. 

## Output 
 That displays the elapsed time, along with a message about whether the player was too fast, too slow, or right on target.
